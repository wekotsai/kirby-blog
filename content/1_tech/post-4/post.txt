### Target element
A DOMString representing the position relative to the targetElement; must match (case-insensitively) one of the following strings: 
<pre><code class="language-css">
element.insertAdjacentText('beforehand', 'Tea');
</pre></code>
1. 'beforebegin': Before the targetElement itself.
2. 'afterbegin': Just inside the targetElement, before its first child.
3. 'beforeend': Just inside the targetElement, after its last child.
4. 'afterend': After the targetElement itself
5. `targetElement.insertAdjacentElement(position, element);`

###Console elements
Dev tools > Network > XHR allows you to see the raw data
1. In dev tools - `$0` to look up element
2. `$0` is the last element you clicked, `$1` is the second last element you clicked
3. `$( 'p' )` the first one that matches the selector
4. `$$( 'p' )` all the ones that match the selector

**Equality comparison operator**
1. Both abstract equality operator `==` and strict equality operator `===` are case sensitive
2. Almost always we should use `===` it always checks the value and the type
3. I.e. `“10” == 10` is *true* but `“10” === 10` *false*

###querySelector vs querySelectorAll
The former selects one single element whereas the latter selects a list of elements
