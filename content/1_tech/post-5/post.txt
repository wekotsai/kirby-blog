###How did I build my blog?
In short, I used Kirby + Netlify!
1. Here's an awesome *(link: https://github.com/d4l-data4life/kirby3-static-site-generator text: Kirby plugin)* built by my colleague Jonathan Reisdorf which allows you to generate static files in Kirby.
2. Create a new repository for the static files.
3. Set up Netlify: Run `netlify-init`
4. Once the changes are pushed in `kirby-blog`, hit **Generate Static Site**
5. Make sure you're in the correct depository. In my case, I created a new repository named `kirby-blog-static`
6. To deploy: Run `netlify deploy --prod` or simply push the changes.
