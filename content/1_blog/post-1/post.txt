Here are a few tips for anchor links that scroll too far down: 

1. Add a pseudo element `::before` along with `content: " ";` and
 `display: block;`
 
2. Add an `<a>` tag with an id right before the targeted element

3. Add `scroll-margin` (append to parent div not pseudo element)

Notes: 
scroll margin doesnâ€™t work on Safari, please refer to (link: caniuse text: https://caniuse.com/?search=scroll-margin-top)
`display: block;` might affect the original layout
