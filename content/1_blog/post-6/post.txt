**Update the master:**
1. Commit/stash all the changes you’re working on in your current branch `git commit -m " "` or `git stash`
2. Switch to master `git checkout master`
3. `git fetch` then `git pull` to update master
4. Switch to branch you were working on
5. `git merge master` and pray there isn’t a merge conflict
