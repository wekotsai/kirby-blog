###How did I build my blog?
In short, I used Kirby + Netlify!
1. Here's an awesome *(link: https://github.com/d4l-data4life/kirby3-static-site-generator text: Kirby plugin)* that was built by my colleague Jonathan and allows you to generate static files.
2. Create a new repository ie kirby-blog-static
3. Set up Netlify: Run `netlify-init` 
4. To deploy: Run `netlify deploy --prod`
